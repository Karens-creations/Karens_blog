And welcome to my blog ‘Tingling Neurons’!

This is a space where I am sharing my thoughts, stories and views on the world. Or get them straight in the first place, since it is often a little bit chaotic in my head 😉

Maybe you are interested in similar topics like me: product management, personal development, productivity, work, philosophy, (neuro-) physiology, travelling, reading and just great stories.

I am passionate about solving problems, according to the motto “Everything is figureoutable.” 
I love how it is possible to solve problems at scale with the right mindset and skills. And how the skills in need fit my personality: I am curious, full of ideas, always eager to learn more, empathetic, communicative, analytical, and I am falling more and more in love with the technical possibilities that are out there. 

As for now, my professional career was focused on improving physical and mental health. I really want to help people live healthier and happier. This is also why I love solving problems. With the digital tools that are out there now, it is possible to do that at scale. 

I like to think of myself as a ‘child of the world’. I love traveling, connecting to people from all around the world, doing sports (especially mountaineering), spending time with myself and reading. I get excited easily, so I am always eager to keep learning and try new stuff. 

If you are interested in education / learning, personal development, productivity (Who is following all those productivity influencers? 🙋‍♀️ 🙈 ), system thinking, philosophical questions, product management, the big problems of the world (and how to solve them), mountaineering or just want to connect, I’ll be happy to talk to you!

And why Tingling Neurons? I like medicine (particularly Physiology) and I am totally amazed by how much can change, if we change our mindset. Also when we develop products. There are the most amazing thoughts and concepts out there, that are definitely worth discussing. So this blog is about my tingling neurons, your tingling neurons and our neurons tingling together. The name was my brothers’ idea, but the passion is definitely mine 😉

I hope you enjoy what’s on this blog, and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon!
