In the pursuit of growth and accomplishment, the art of goal setting plays a crucial role. But how does one strike the delicate balance between aspirational targets and realistic expectations to ensure sustainability in the long run? We all aim to progress steadily without succumbing to the burnout that often accompanies relentless striving.

Goal Achievement — Optimists vs. Pessimists During a comprehensive exploration of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), I stumbled upon an unexpected insight from positive psychology. Counter to our intuition, optimists are not necessarily the best at achieving their goals. Odd as it may sound, unwavering positivity can leave one unprepared for potential setbacks. Someone planning for good weather seldom packs an umbrella for unexpected storms.

Conversely, pessimists, equipped with their cautious worldviews, are often better prepared for the rain. They do not only pack an umbrella, but also a raincoat, and rain pants.

The paradox of aim and outcome Despite a tendency to miss their lofty ambitions, optimists frequently outperform their cautious counterparts. Their audacious goals — even when not fully realized — usually propel them to greater heights than the precautious targets set by pessimists, who may simply aspire to reach the safety of their rooftop and do no more.

# So, what can we learn from that?
Inspired by this philosophical dichotomy, I experimented with my goal-setting strategy. Last week marked the beginning of a dual-goal approach. I have set myself both a baseline goal and an adventurous stretch goal. It’s like having a safety net, but still going for the stars.

*The Baseline Goal*
The baseline goal served as a foundation for success — a milestone that warranted a modest celebration upon its attainment. Yet, my gaze remained fixed on the more formidable stretch goal.

*The Stretch Goal*
The stretch goal was designed to push boundaries and venture into the realm of “what’s possible.” The act of setting such an ambitious target was not about perfection, but about expanding my horizons. I embraced the possibility of falling short, acknowledging that each effort would take me further than I would have gone without such an aspiration.

*The result?* The initial success at the baseline provided not only a boost in drive but also a seamless transition toward my stretch goal, coupled with the gratification of not having to recalibrate goals mid-journey. The roadmap was clear, allowing me to sustain momentum. And even though this did not happen this week, I think it is great to have that “red flag” whenever you wouldn’t even reach your baseline goal.

In the end, I really enjoyed the blend of pragmatism and optimism. The baseline goal ensures a tangible sense of progress, safeguarding against discouragement when things are not going the way we want them to. The stretch goal serves as motivation to put in the extra work. And reaching that extra ambitious goal is even more rewarding.

Also, setting a spectrum of goals can really improve planning, when else might be coming up.
