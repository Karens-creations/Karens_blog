You see them as you are.
Change yourself and you change the world - ‘How to live’ by Derek Sivers

A set of guiding principles that I aim to incorporate into my life.

## Action Orientation

- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Being successful is rarely about your ability to plan – it’s about your ability to act.
- Progress not Perfection.  
Pain + Reflection = Progress. (Ray Dalio)
- **Be careful about over-planning** - get started, but do not act carelessly. Over-planning is often procrastination in disguise – our brain loves doing what feels rewarding now (doing research, reading, watching video tutorials) instead of starting the hard work.
- **Take responsibility** - Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.
- **Hell Yeah or No** - Each day is a new battle to say yes to what matters and say no to what doesn’t. Focus is a practice. **** -James Clear
- **Focus on what you can control** – Expending energy on anything beyond that is futile.
- **Quality over Quantity & Effectiveness Over Efficiency** – Doing the right things is more important than doing things well. Do less, but better = Focus.
- You can change, accept or leave the situation.
- **Progressive escalation** – Try the simplest, least risky, and/or cheapest solution first.
- **Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior** – People can change, they just usually don’t.

## Thinking Orientation

- **Define your problem, needs and goal** - Clarify the problem thoroughly before exploring solutions, ensuring it's indeed the correct problem to address.
- **Optionality** - Choose things that have little downside, but a lot or unlimited upside.
- **Antifragility** - Choose Things that get stronger from stress, chaos and disorder.
- Make learning a priority, always.
- Focus more on making the pie bigger than on exactly how to slice it.
- Practice being present.
- Use Checklists.
- Think in terms of evolution - Do experiments, gather as much information as you can. Evolve.
- **Fail well.** Everyone fails, so fail well. Create a Culture in Which It Is Okay to Make Mistakes and in which it is unacceptable not to Learn From Them.
- **Weigh second and third-order consequences** - Often the first order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and can be the barriers that stand in our way.
- New is overvalued relative to great (von Ray Dalio)
- **Opportunity Cost** – Resources are limited. Every time you chose something you say no to something else.
- **Dare to let go** - Prioritize the right decision now over upholding prior decisions and resources that have become sunk costs.
- There is always a silver lining.
- **Memento mori** – Remember that you will die. Time is limited.
- **Existence is governed by probabilities** – Employ probabilistic reasoning to enhance your decision-making.

## Feeling

- **Breathe** - To gain energy. Before reacting out of any powerful emotion. To become present again.
- **This too shall pass** - both the favorable and the unfavorable moments.
- **When you hit your goals, celebrate!**
- Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement (von Ray Dalio)
- **Weaknesses - you choose:** Deny them. Accept them (move around them or work on them). Change the situation. And remember that all weaknesses don’t matter if you find solutions.

## Dynamic Balance / Polarity **vs**. Balance / Equilibrium

Dynamic Balance is the intriguing concept that occasionally embracing extremes can yield better results than perpetually seeking a consistent equilibrium. This notion stems from our inherent ability to adapt to unchanging circumstances over time.

Consider the realm of fitness: Progress is accelerated when alternating between intense workouts one day and restorative breaks the next, as opposed to adhering to a monotonous routine. Similarly, in relationships, the enchantment of a partnership can fade with familiarity; a temporary separation can rekindle appreciation and allow for a fresh perspective upon reunion.

However, it's imperative to recognize that pursuing extremes across all aspects of life can be demanding. Hence, seeking balance in certain domains, such as nutrition, hygiene, and habitual activities, is essential to conserving energy.

Essentially, Dynamic Balance serves as an approach to fostering improvement and growth, encouraging us to oscillate between intense focus on specific goals while embracing fluctuations. On the other hand, a state of equilibrium is advantageous for maintaining various facets of life. It's prudent to acknowledge that true progress necessitates honing in on one or two objectives at a time, allowing dedicated attention. In contrast, the remaining aspects of life can be harmoniously sustained by skillfully navigating the balance between extremes.
