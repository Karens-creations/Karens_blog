[Tibah](www.tibah.io) is your guide to introspection & reflection. It gives you a customizable guideline to reflect on what matters to you every day to cultivate a healthier and happier life

**Daily Reflections** keep you connected with what's important to you - your actions, values, principles, and all those little sparks of inspiration. They offer a personal space to capture everything that matters most to you, from boosting well-being to ramping up productivity, and even getting healthier with the habit tracker.

**Weekly Reflections** provide a semi-high-level reflection moment, enabling you to assess how effectively you're acting on your core values and priorities. These reflections act as both a mirror and a roadmap, guiding you towards becoming the best version of yourself, informed by real-life feedback and experiences.

**Monthly Reflections** serve two pivotal purposes. Firstly, they provide a structured opportunity to review and assess your progress towards your set goals, helping you stay on track. Secondly, these reflections offer a holistic overview of your life's various aspects, ensuring that while moving forward with your goals, you are also maintaining a balanced and fulfilling life.

**Yearly Reflection:** Dive deep into your past year, unravel patterns in relationships, events, and what brings you joy. Then, visualise your goals for the next year, setting up a personalised journal that reminds you of your values, goals, and the actions you want to take to reach them. This way, you never lose sight of what's really important to you.
