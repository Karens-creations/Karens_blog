# Hello Stranger

My name ist Karen. I am passionate about solving problems, according to the motto “Everything is figureoutable.” 
I love how it is possible to solve problems at scale with the right mindset and skills. And how the skills in need fit my personality: I am curious, full of ideas, always eager to learn more, empathetic, communicative, analytical, and I am falling more and more in love with the technical possibilities that are out there. 

As for now, my professional career was focused on improving physical and mental health. I really want to help people live healthier and happier. This is also why I love solving problems. With the digital tools that are out there now, it is possible to do that at scale. 

I like to think of myself as a ‘child of the world’. I love traveling, connecting to people from all around the world, doing sports (especially mountaineering), spending time with myself and reading. I get excited easily, so I am always eager to keep learning and try new stuff. 

If you are interested in education / learning, personal development, productivity (Who is following all those productivity influencers? 🙋‍♀️ 🙈 ), system thinking, philosophical questions, product management, the big problems of the world (and how to solve them), mountaineering or just want to connect, I’ll be happy to talk to you!
