Here it is best to go with a mix of output and outcome goals (e.g. focused on delivering a feature or action within a specific timeframe). While OKRs seem to be a simple framework, they are rarely used to their full potential. They are seen as a linear process, rather than a feedback loop, that drives rapid learning and impact for the company. Here are some golden rules, which will make setting OKRs more powerful for you: Utilize outcome-oriented OKRs: Outcome-oriented OKRs focus the team on driving business value rather than dictating a single way of how to do things. You might be surprised by the solutions your team comes up with. Think of OKRs as feedback loops: By implementing review processes within your OKR process, you will learn important facts about your business and customers. Use OKRs in a larger system: To harness the full power of OKRs, they should be viewed as one piece within a larger system and thus compliment your strategy.

Even though I do not have it all figured out yet (who has?), I learned a few important lessons about goals along the way. That is about the different kind of goals there are, how to size them, when they are useful and when they are not, how to keep track of them and how I want to implement them into my life. In this article, I want to share some of my thoughts with you. And yes, there is even more to come. My next article will focus on OKRs. Different levels of goals First of all, there are goals on different levels. Reaching from big visions to small items on your daily to-do list. In an ideal world, higher level goals should break down into lower level goals, so you work towards what you want to achieve in life. That also includes being careful that your private goals fit your professional goals. Don‚Äôt have too many goals at once. Dare to focus on what matters most. What we tend to do is act out of the situation, without asking if a certain to-do item is beneficial to one of our aspirations in life. Or even questioning doing it at all. Often times we do things, because we are asked to do them or feel obligated, rather than things leading us into a certain direction. But I will come back to that later. Before that, let‚Äôs talk about the different kinds of goals. ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/goals/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Goals","uri":"/goals/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Different types of goals From my understanding, there are basically four types of goals. Input goals, output goals, outcome goals and non goals. Input goals are about the effort you put in. E.g. work on a blog post for X time, watering the plants ones a week, working on a project for X hours‚Ä¶ They are perfect in situations where it is tough to motivate yourself, so the best thing you can do is put one foot in front of the other. Input goals are a 100% your responsibility, because you can control how much you put in. Usually, when we talk about habits, we talk about input goals. Output Goals are about a certain number, or result, that you want to create as output. E.g. I have written 1000 words for my new book, I send out X Mails to new clients, I have designed one new flowchart for project X‚Ä¶ These goals are perfect if you want to focus on the result of a specific task, because the result matters. Input and output goals are sometimes tough to differentiate. It helps if you ask yourself: Why am I setting that goal in the first place? What do I want to achieve? This will make it easier for you to decide if an input or an output goal is a better fit. For some goals it makes more of a difference than in others. For example running. It makes a difference if you say ‚ÄúI go running five days a week.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI run 20 km per week.‚Äù You can do 20 km in two sessions, but also in five. Five days a week can add up to 10 km or 50 km. So why are you running? To get a regular workout? To train for a marathon? To get better and better? The important thing is that your goal reflects what you want to achieve. Outcome Goals are about the result you want to create. Not in terms of output, but on a higher level. E.g. increasing conversion of Lead to Sale Ratio by X, decreasing churn rate by X or improving physical wellbeing by reducing body fat percentage by X%. The essential thing here is that none of these goals imply how to achieve it, which is the whole magic about outcome goals. You can reduce body fat percentage by eating less or exercising more or even both. Three totally different approaches and they all work. So outcome goals are amazing if you do not want to limit yourself on a single way of how to do something, but rather care about achieving it in the first place. There might be solutions to your problem that work even better than the one you first thought of, but you can only discover them if you are not fixed on a single solution already. Non goals are the most underestimated goals of all. No one talks about them, but they can be crucially important. Especially in business contexts. Non goals are about writing down what it is that you do not want to achieve by a certain intervention. Let‚Äôs say there was an initiative at your company to increase the number of customers to gain more visibility in the market and prepare for a big launch the company has next year. If increasing the revenue is a non goal or a goal is critical for a lot of decisions along the way. If not clarified (if revenue is part of the goal or not), miscommunication between teams is very likely. Thus slowing down progress and probably creating the need to rework things, people already put a lot of time and effort into.

Personally, I implemented the goals into my personal life system. Professionally, it helped me with setting the right OKRs and building successful products. Since I will be focussing on the business side of things in my next post, let me tell you about my personal life system for now. There are goals which are quite short term and can be easily achieved. And then there are the more difficult goals, which are about what you care for deeply and what you want to achieve in your life. What is it that makes you happy? Since taking the Life Design course by August Bradley I went through an intense reflection process, in which you systemically break down your vision, until you get out specific action items. Here is how you do it. First, you figure out your vision. What is it that you want to do with your life? Who do you want to be? What would a life look like, in which you are truly happy and fulfilled? What would need to be true for a life like this to be possible? This vision is what you use to set your value goals. Value goals are not SMART. They reflect what you want to achieve in life. E.g. one value goal for me is to live in a fulfilling relationship, and another is to proceed in a career that contributes to a bigger purpose, adding value for the world. These goals you cannot really achieve. They are not there to be achieved, but to give you direction. Ones you have your value goals, you break them down into Outcome Goals (for this year or even the next years). Outcome goals are measurable and (in my case) long term. These can be reached in a quarter, a year or a couple of years. Outcome goals are then broken down into projects or habits. Projects are perfect for the things that you like to learn / do / experience. For getting to a certain point. Habits are great for holding or improving a certain state, that needs continuous care. Depending on the outcome goal you can also set X projects, combined with X habits to reach it. I only started this project a couple of months ago, but I can already say that it fills my life with a lot more purpose. Because for most of the things I am doing now, I know why I do them. ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/goals/:0:2","tags":null,"title":"Goals","uri":"/goals/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Mindset: How do you stick to goals? Another learning I want to share with you is how to stick to the goals you set for yourself. The first trick I already mentioned above. Once you know why you are doing the things you do, they are way easier to follow through with. The second mindset shift is to think differently about discipline. Usually discipline is about difficult tasks, that we do not particularly like, but still want to finish. Another way to think about discipline is that it is actually a form of showing yourself respect. Let me explain. If you promise a friend to meet him at the gym. Would you dare to cancel time and time again? Even if you would do it once, you would not do it again and again, since you want to be a good friend. We are the most important person in our life. And we cancel or go against our promises all the time. We treat ourselves way differently than we treat others. But it is just as significant to be reliable to ourselves, as it is to be reliable to our friends. And having the discipline to follow through on our commitments to ourselves also shows us that we have respect for the goals that we have set. Which kind of person do you want to be? The one that shows up, even if they had a tough day? Or the one bailing once it gets hard? And this brings me to the third mindset. Make the goals and habits you create about your identity. That way, it is way easier to follow through with certain goals. If one of your goals is to get fit ‚Äì next time you have a craving for chocolate, ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person that skips the gym and eats chocolate instead. The same goes for business ‚Äì the next time you do not like a certain decision or task, ask yourself if you want to be the person that complains about it and makes him/herself the victim of the situation. Or if you would not rather be someone who stands up for his/her opinion, gets out of the comfort zone and takes things into his/her own hands.

One last thing that I always have to keep in mind ‚Äì and I know a lot of productive people face the same challenge ‚Äì is that you do not always have to have a goal.

There should be time to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù for something stupid, new or funny. Or anything else that is not there for X or to achieve X. If we have too many responsibilities, we lose our ease. There should be time to just relax, do nothing or do whatever you feel like doing. Be careful that your life does not become a checklist.

This is not something I would really want to discuss here, but to break it down: I had a few realizations about the company I work for and a few realizations about myself, which were tough for me to accept. And as it is: the first thing acceptance leads to is anger, disappointment and/or frustration. And I am not one to sit around in a situation I do not like. So there was one week when I almost felt like quitting. But then I asked myself: Do I want to just leave? Or do I want to stay and at least try to change something and thus learn about if I would be able to change things? The silver lining in the whole situation (yes, already now, only one week after): I learned a lot about motivation and this is what I want to share with you. There are two types of motivation. Intrinsic motivation, which comes from within you. And extrinsic motivation, which you get from others or from the circumstances you are in. Luckily, the first kind of motivation is not something that is magically there or not. You have total control over your intrinsic motivation, because it depends on your mindset.

How could you contribute to the situation? Is there something you could learn, that would help you to handle the situation? What could be a first step in the right direction? And last, but not least, it always helps to ask: What can you learn from the situation itself? Taking a look at what is in our power and what we actually can do, changes our behavior from complaining (which is more of a victim to the situation attitude) to agency.

Or did you lose track of it? What effect do you hope the project will have, ones it is a success? Is there a bigger picture that you could remind yourself of? We often lose perspective, when we get caught up in everyday life. If there is a purpose to the project: What could be a way for you to see / remind yourself of that purpose again and again? The right purpose is a major motivation factor, because it connects to your inner belief system. If you cannot change the situation or your attitude towards the situation, there is only one option left: Leave. I am serious. Leave. If you have no motivation at all, extrinsic factors only go so far and usually do not make you happy. You will not benefit from the situation.

First of all, I am not okay with some parts of the culture we are living in our team and company right now. And secondly, I was missing a few things personally. Luckily, these are things I am able to change. So I have decided to talk more about the things I do not like within our culture, but also to offer solutions on how we can approach it instead. This has worked quite well so far and the experience I make is, that most people feel the same way. As for the things I am missing personally, I have figured out strategies on where I could ask for it more, or do it within my free time.

About the lives that we can change. And this really motivates me, to put in the best work, I possibly can.

You need to have a plan B, C and D, so you know, when plan A is not creating the best value anymore. And that would be the point to leave the negotiation. Also: go to choice B \u0026 C before you go to choice A, so you have an As up your sleeve when you talk to your preferred partner. And you only have an As up your sleeve, if you put it there. So do your research! Bring proof of your objective criteria with you and think about which questions could come up. An if you already talked to option B \u0026 C, you can be really honest and say: ‚ÄòI already talked to them.

Whichever number is on the table first, will give orientation for the rest of the negotiation. So after you did your homework, you thought about value, and you know your price, you set a number for yourself. This number represents the best offer you can think of. And I mean the offer you dream of, because most times, we do not ask for enough. We rarely get more, than we asked for. We usually get less. So put a bit of buffer in there. Also: set the minimum requirements, that would need to be fulfilled for you to still say yes to the deal. This way you have a clear exit point. In the negotiation, you present your value and the reasoning for your price, and then you name your dream offer. And then, be quiet. Be confident about your offer and do not justify it. This first number, that is in the room, is the anchor. It has power, so let it sink in.

In the negotiation, after you presented your value, you could say something like ‚ÄòFor this kind of project, a company like McKinsey would charge you about 150,000.

When I watched Chris Voss course on Masterclass about negotiation, it was one of the key elements for a successful negotiation.

Whenever you ask questions, use the other person‚Äôs choice of words. And then really listen to what they have to say. Be honestly interested in whatever it is they are talking about.

So if you label the other person‚Äôs emotion, he/she reflects upon what it is, they are actually feeling. And this calms them down. So even if your label is incorrect, it will work. The other person will just correct you and thus give you more information about them. Another amazing thing is, that this also works for positive emotions, but the other way.

Since we do not need to retain everything in our brain, the process acts as a filter that protects us from the flood of information we are confronted with every day. Important information gradually transfers from short-term memory to long-term memory. The more often information is repeated or used and the more emotionally charged it is, the more likely it is to eventually end up in long-term memory to be retained.

It can store about four to seven items for no more than 20 or 30 seconds each. This capacity can be increased via various memory strategies. For example, a ten-digit number like 8005840392 can overwhelm the short-term memory. However, when broken down into parts, as with a phone number, 800-584-0-392 it can remain in short-term memory long enough for us to dial it. We group the available information, so that it can be remembered more easily. This is called chunking.

Simply put, a chunk is a collection of related information. Something like a schema, a learning unit, or a functional unit. It has no clear boundary and there are no fixed chunks. Each person forms his or her own units. Thus, the word chunk is more of an abstract concept than clearly defined. Chunks can be used to learn something new or interconnect topics with each other. Or we get new information on a topic for which we already have chunks in the long-term memory. In this case, we usually find it easier to remember something because we can link it to the information we already have. The more extensive the mental library of learning units, the easier it is to remember. So in general, if you want to learn something new, look at the big picture first to give your brain some orientation. This way it can perceive the context, and you can add details to the framework later on. When we learn something new, networks are built from the information units. Short-term memory can usually handle 4 -7 chunks at a time. When first learning a concept or technique to solve a problem, the entire working memory (aka short-term memory) is involved. Whenever we fragment a concept, the individual components will connect more easily and smoothly. Thus, only one space in the working memory is occupied. The rest of the working memory remains free. By fragmenting the material, the amount of information available in the working memory has, in a sense, increased. At the same time, it is easier to make new connections. Gradually, the learner recognizes connections between the new information and chunks that are already stored.

These are called networks because they are made up of interconnected neurons (cells in the central nervous system) and act as electrical circuits in the brain. The focused mindset is active when you actively engage in a task and focus on it. The fuzzy mode of thinking is active when thoughts ‚Äúdigress,‚Äù colloquially known as daydream mode. Here seemingly disparate thoughts (from different subject areas) can be combined so that subject areas can be logically connected. We thus develop an intuitive assessment of topics. This brain state, characterized by the flow of connections between different ideas and thoughts, is responsible for the moments of highest creativity and insight, when we are able to solve problems that previously seemed unsolvable. ¬† ¬† ¬† These two attention networks are exclusive: when one is active, the other is not. The switch between daydreaming and attention is controlled in a part of the brain called the insula. This is an important structure that lies about one centimeter below the surface of the skull. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Another important structure in the brain, concerning learning, is the hippocampus. It is located about in the middle of the brain and is part of the limbic system, one of the oldest parts of our brain that regulates automated behaviors and emotions. The hippocampus is responsible for learning and remembering facts and events. Each separate sensation travels to the hippocampus, which combines these perceptions into a single experience. Without the hippocampus, it is not possible to store new memories in the cortex. ¬† ¬† ¬† Experts believe that the hippocampus, along with another part of the brain called the frontal cortex, is responsible for analyzing different sensory inputs and deciding whether they are worth remembering. If they are, they can be incorporated into long-term memory, that is, stored in different parts of the brain. And this happens via neural networks.

Learning something new, neurons connect to other cells at a point called a synapse. All brain processes take place at these synapses, where electrical impulses or chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) jump across the gaps between cells like messages. The electrical firing in a neuron triggers the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters diffuse through the spaces between cells and connect with neighboring cells. They are enormously important for learning, which is why we will return to them in more detail in a moment. Each brain cell can form thousands of such connections, so a typical brain has about 100 trillion synapses. Learning and remembering do not happen by changing the overall structure of the brain or by creating neurons, but by establishing connections between cells that change during learning. The connections between brain cells are not fixed, but are constantly changing. Brain cells work together in a network and organize themselves into groups that specialize in different ways of processing information. When one brain cell sends signals to another, the synapse between the two becomes stronger. The more signals sent, the stronger the connection becomes. So with each new experience, the physical structure of the brain is slightly altered.

Most neurons in the cortex carry information about what is going on around us and what is currently happening in and to the body. The brain also has a number of diffuse projection neuromodulator systems that assess information, not about the content of an experience, but about its meaning and value for one‚Äôs future. In this context, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are especially important. Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections with the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when attention is high. Thus, they increase our focus. Our dopamine release is responsible for our motivation and is produced in the brain stem. It is released when we are interested in something, open-minded and curious, focused on a goal, and/or working to achieve something. Dopaminergic neurons are part of our reward system. It is not only responsible for sensing a reward, but also for predicting future rewards. It motivates you to do something that may not be rewarding at the moment, but will lead to a much better reward in the future. Addictive drugs, for example, artificially increase dopamine activity and trick the brain into thinking that something wonderful is about to happen or they directly increase secretion of dopamine. To be able to focus on something, the brain needs just the right amount of the so-called catecholamines ‚Äì particularly dopamine and norepinephrine ‚Äì placed at a variety of synapses. To increase dopamine levels in a learning situation, the content must be relevant, i.e., the learner must recognize the value (e.g., potential reward) from unlocking the content. One way to achieve this is to make learning situations as ‚Äúreal‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù as possible, e.g., by using advanced simulations or games. Or by rewarding certain activities Norepinephrine can be released during competitive activities or when we feel pressure to perform, such as when we have a deadline to meet. It makes us feel alert and awake. Last but not least, Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that strongly influences our social life. Serotonin levels are also closely related to risk-taking behaviors, as these are more likely to occur with elevated serotonin levels. That might not seem directly related to learning, but if we increase our willingness to take risks, we also increase the probability to try something new, make mistakes and ask difficult questions. To put this all into very easy words: Every time we do something, we have to repeat it or give it emotional meaning, so new pathways are formed and trained. In the realm of personal development, there is a quite famous mnemonic picture for this, which might make it easier for you to remember: Learning something new is like scarfing through the brushwood for the first time. It is very tough, takes a long time and there is only a little path. But the more you walk that path (repeat what you have learned), the more established it gets. It gets bigger and bigger over time. There are more and more connections leading to the path and in the end you have a solid street that you can travel on. I hope, with this in mind, you will find it easier to tackle new topics in the future and actively create your own learning experience. I will give you some inspiration on how you can do that (hands on) in the upcoming blog posts! So stay tuned!

It is a wonderful and easy read, with a lot of take-aways. If you are struggling with regret, it might be the perfect book for you. The midnight library is about a woman called Nora Seeds.

Because with every decision we make and also the ones, we do not make, we choose a different path. And that path has all the ups and downs that came as a result of the decision made. So it happens that Nora still gets a chance to live all the lives she regretted not living. And she learns that these lives are not perfect either.

Last week I had an interesting discussion with a friend about different kind of skills. In case you are wandering, what exactly we mean by skills, we defined it as applied knowledge. Knowledge can be gathered by passive or active learning or simply by experiences we make. Skill development is also a topic I currently want to focus on more. I always had the benefit of working in an area, where I develop skills, that are very broad and that I can use in different surroundings. These would include skills like communication, organizing, problem-solving, thinking new ways and coming up with all sorts of ideas‚Ä¶ These kind of skills are meta skills and they are the best ones to achieve early on in life. Usually then, we do not know who we want to be, how exactly we want to live our life, where we want to work and what we want to work as. Most soft skills eg. are meta skills, since you have to work with people in most jobs and you have to get along with them in your personal life too. So it is great to get a broad basis of skills, that you can use in most situations. I never really thought about developing them on purpose, though, which is definitely something I want to change. And then there are skills, that are quite fit to an area. These are more expert skills, that you need in a specific context. Eg. in software development you would want to be good at coding. But then it is also interesting to see, how two skills, if put together, can elicit a synergy. So if they are put together, they are worth more, then each skill by itself. Eg. storytelling. That is basically a skill that helps you to communicate your expertise to other people. Thus it helps you to get your point across, facilitate learning for others and move people to decide in a certain way. Out of this, my friend and I talked about different skill concepts, like I-shaped, T-shaped and œÄ ‚Äì shaped skill profiles. I ‚Äì shaped basically means, that you are an expert in one thing. So there is one skill, where you are the best compared to people in your surrounding, or you are even somewhere in the top 5% from all people. These are true experts. A T ‚Äì Shaped skill profile means, that the person (or it can be even a team) has a broad fundament of skills and is a true Expert in one thing. œÄ ‚Äì shaped means, as I described above, that you have a broad fundament of skills and that you are an expert in two things. These skills usually benefit each other, if you combine them. These skill profiles can be used to describe skill levels or meta vs. expert skills. Eg. describing the skill level for T-shape: that would mean that you have a basic knowledge of a lot of different skills, but you are only truly mastering one skill. Meta vs. Expert skills means that where some skills are beneficial in multiple areas, some are only useful in a very specific context. So here is how I will proceed from this discussion onwards. I will write down the meta skills and skills I already have. I will write down the goals I want to reach personally and at work. And then I will reflect on where the biggest leverages are skill wise to get where I want to be. Maybe these skills can then also be useful in different life areas. So basically I am going to ask myself: Which are the ones, that will not only help me in this particular goal or life area, but also in others? Now the important meta skills are probably the ones I will go for first, since they are useful in so many contexts. The next step would be to choose a skill and to come up with a way of how I can acquire the knowledge and experience to build it. Hopefully this finds you well and you can take away something from our little discussion.

A new study suggests that it has something to do with the detoxification of our brain. Just like we cannot be stressed and relaxed at the same time, the body can only detoxify, ones it shuts down our conscious mind.

Whenever there is a lot of adenosine in your brain you have trouble staying awake and your brain stops working as efficiently as it could. Also there is something called melatonin, which a lot of you probably already heard about. It is thought to induce sleep. A lot of people even think it is responsible for making you fall asleep, but it is not. It is only there to make you feel tired. The accumulation of adenosine then makes you fall asleep. BUT: Whenever Melatonin is blocked (eg. by blue light) it might happen that you go to bed way to late, so you do not have enough time to recover. This can sometimes lead to a Vicious cycle, because you feel tired during the day, then start drinking more caffeine and thus have trouble falling asleep at night. So before discussing how you can improve your sleep, let us talk about the phases and benefits of sleep.

This is the sleep phase in which we dream and which is characterised by rapid eye movements. REM sleep is important for the formation of memories, creativity and the recovery of body and mind. It accounts for 5% to 50% of total sleep time. Light sleep accounts for about 50% of total sleep time for an adult. While deep sleep is considered the most regenerative sleep phase, light sleep also helps your body recover. Deep sleep is very important for the general regeneration of the body. When you are in deep sleep, your blood pressure drops, your arm and leg muscles are relaxed and it is harder to wake up. During deep sleep, your muscles grow and regenerate, your immune system recovers and your brain detoxifies. On average, adults spend 15-20% of their sleeping time in deep sleep. This percentage usually decreases with age.

Cut down on caffeine. Caffeine has a longer half life than you might think. For the average person it makes sense not to drink caffeine after 3pm. And be careful! Energy drinks, mate and tea also have caffeine or similar substances. Reduce your Screen time before bed. The blue light emitted from your devices limits melatonin secretion, so you feel tired later than you usually would. A solution might be to download an app that filters out blue light, so your body can get back to its natural day night rythm. Get sun light. This also helps with the day and night rythm and it helps with the production of vitamin D, which is important in a lot of different metabolic processes. Eat enough protein. You need protein, so you can synthesize all hormones and messenger molecules. Sleep in a dark and cool bedroom. If your body cannot cool down properly, it will effect sleep quality. Establish a regular bed and wakeup routine. Especially waking up at almost the same time every day is super important, so your inner clock can adjust itself properly. Only go to bed when you feel sleepy. You will be able to sleep faster That helps with developing the right mindset and beliefs like ‚ÄúI am able to fall asleep easily‚Äù. Never lie in bed awake for a prolonged time, rather go out and do something until you feel sleepy again. Avoid daytime napping, if you have trouble sleeping at night. Reduce anxiety provoking thoughts (eg. meditate or write them down). In general: Write down all the things that are on your mind, especially if it is stuff you are afraid to forget (E.g. ‚ÄúI have to buy milk tomorrow‚Äù) If you sleep in a noisy environment, try out listening to white noise. Wear warm socks while sleeping. This helps you to relax, cools down your bodies core temperature and get more restorative sleep. I swear it helps! Take a warm shower before bed. This also reduces your bodies core temperature. Get enough exercise during the day. But do not exercise too close before bedtime. Do breathing exercises to relax during the day, so you activate your parasympathetic nervous system. Get your nutrients in, so your body can function right. Do not eat too shortly before you go to bed, so your digestion has time to process the food. Get lots of sex. This helps you to relax and the hormones, that are released, boost restorative sleep. Do not drink alcohol shortly before going to bed. It messes with your deep sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep: Counting helps for a lot of people. Or a method I particularly like: Visualize going on a travel you have been on before ‚Äì in as much detail as you can. Imagine what you wore, how your apartment looked, when you left, which kind of baggage you had with you, how you closed the door and turned the keys, how you walked down the stairs‚Ä¶ Imagine it as detailed as you can. That will certainly keep you brain busy. And it might effect your dreams in really nice ways. Hope one or the other tip helps!

That means break down that ‚Äòsuper huge and overwhelming thing‚Äô into pieces. And then make a plan for handling these pieces. But as simple as this idea is, the hardest part is often to get that this is what you need to do, especially when you are stressed. And it is totally normal to be stressed and overwhelmed once in a while. I get stressed out, just like everyone else, if there is too much, that is put on my plate in one go. Especially if that includes things I haven‚Äôt done before or that make me feel insecure for some reason. For example if there is too much change all at ones, so I do not really have enough orientation within the different life areas. But once I actually see that it is manegable what I have to do, I feel way better about it. Confident, that I can do it. So: At the end of last year there was a strategic change at work, which put me in the place to manage 7 different projects, out of which one is really big, five are about medium and two are ‚Äújust‚Äù concepts. So I felt totally overwhelmed and like I did not even know where to start. So what I did is I wrote down all the projects and what I have to do in each of them. I also created an overview of my every day \u0026 weekly tasks. Then I wrote down the deadlines for each of those projects and the critical steps within the project. In the end I took out a piece of paper, wrote down the weeks of Q1, planned in the hard deadlines first and then planned in the other pieces of the different projects, so I felt like I would be able to manage the amount of work within that week. That means: There is still a buffer within each week for spontaneous work, that coming up. And I made sure I would have enough time to certainly finish everything for the hard deadlines.

So the work you have to do does not feel like that overwhelmingly big thing anymore. I feels manegable. Every time, you start to feel overwhelmed again: you can tell yourself you sliced the elephant. You have planned everything in and you have an exact idea about what it is exactly, that you need to do. Once you have a plan like that, you can put it into a project planning software (like Trello, Asana, Jira), which will make it even easier for you. You can share your board with other people and also give tasks to them, if possible. Also if you are coworking with other people, they will know what is on your plate currently. You can share the information within the tickets easily. You get a roadmap with all the important deadlines. And you can blend out the tickets, that will only be important in the future, so you are not hit with tasks that might only be done in five month to come. You have a single point of truth on where to find the work you did already. Side note: Before you actually try ‚ÄòSlicing the elephant‚Äô, definitely ask yourself, if you have to do everything.

Also I wanted my head to be fresh for reading and writing and it was important for me to have time in the evenings for friends etc. But the hour a day definitely did it for me, once I knew how to time it. What I also did is found ‚Äúfocus afternoons‚Äù at the weekends, where I would really focus and dive into the thesis. And actually both are habits I am keeping. Now I read one hour every morning (which is actually something I enjoy a lot) and use the ‚Äúfocus afternoons‚Äù to really do a deep dive into a topic and write a blogpost. Best thing I saw about habits so far is a video by Ali Abdaal, where he summarizes ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù by James Clear. Once you figured out what your habits are going to be, put in appointments with yourself. I am serious. This helps, because it makes sure you will do it (if you respect the slots) and you can let go of the thesis during the other parts of the day, since you know you have set a time to work for the thesis.

So even if motivation and time are low, you will do a little bit every day, which will bring you closer to your goal of finishing the thesis. You will be surprised: Often, when the bell rings after 25 min, you will have the motivation to continue. You can also set the timer for 45, 50 or even 360 min. Just adapt the breaks if you do longer sessions, your body and brain need it. I would recommend starting with short sessions in the beginning though.
