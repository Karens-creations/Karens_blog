    <description><![CDATA[And welcome to my blog ‚ÄòTingling Neurons‚Äô!
This is a space where I am sharing my thoughts, stories and views on the world. Or get them straight in the first place, since it is often a little bit chaotic in my head üòâ
Maybe you are interested in similar topics like me: product management, personal development, productivity, work, philosophy, (neuro-) physiology, travelling and great stories.
And why Tingling Neurons? I like medicine (particularly Physiology) and I am totally amazed by how much can change, if we change our mindset.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[OKRs are usually viewed as a tool to track progress towards a specific goal. They are set up depending on what the company is planning to do or based on a problem the company has at that point in time.
However, this does not leverage the whole power of OKRs.
What are OKRs? OKRs are objective key results. They are usually defined within a quarter, but they can also contribute to a goal that you want to achieve within a year.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This year, I reflected a lot on who I am and what I want to do with my life.
Even though I do not have it all figured out yet (who has?), I learned a few important lessons about goals along the way. That is about the different kind of goals there are, how to size them, when they are useful and when they are not, how to keep track of them and how I want to implement them into my life.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Recently I had a real low in motivation, and it was pretty hard for me to put in the effort at work, which is something I do not experience often, so it was quite a bummer. Why? This is not something I would really want to discuss here, but to break it down: I had a few realizations about the company I work for and a few realizations about myself, which were tough for me to accept.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Brain fog is, when you feel like there is kind of fog around your thinking. You are not focused, you feel like you are daydreaming all the time and whenever you try to concentrate, it takes a ton of energy.
I experienced this for a while, and it was annoying me so much, I did a quick, but intense research on the topic. Here is what helped me:
Eat a lot of fiber Not the first thought one might have, but definitely what helped me most.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Negotiation is a skill I only recently learned about. As some of you might know, I am a Product and Content manager at Greator. And for our Business Coach program, I recently shot with Jack Nasher, THE Negotiation expert in Germany. Since I did not think about negotiation a lot before, I want to share with you, what I have learned, and what really surprised me about the topic.

    <description><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered how learning works exactly? After reading this article, you will know exactly what is happening in your brain, whenever you learn something new.
Storing memories Many experts believe that we store memories via a three-step process: first, we perceive information via our senses, then we store and process it in short-term memory, and finally, some memories, we store in long-term memory. Since we do not need to retain everything in our brain, the process acts as a filter that protects us from the flood of information we are confronted with every day.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Is your life full of regrets? A friend recommended the book ‚ÄúThe midnight library‚Äù by Matt Haig to me. She read it in her vacation and said, that it is one of those books, that is packaging personal development into a beautiful story. And I have to say I agree. It is a wonderful and easy read, with a lot of take-aways. If you are struggling with regret, it might be the perfect book for you.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Here are some thoughts about how to develop the right skills for a life you want to live. Last week I had an interesting discussion with a friend about different kind of skills. In case you are wandering, what exactly we mean by skills, we defined it as applied knowledge. Knowledge can be gathered by passive or active learning or simply by experiences we make.
Skill development is also a topic I currently want to focus on more.]]></description>
