After reading this article, you will know exactly what is happening in your brain, whenever you learn something new.\nStoring memories Many experts believe that we store memories via a three-step process: first, we perceive information via our senses, then we store and process it in short-term memory, and finally, some memories, we store in long-term memory. Since we do not need to retain everything in our brain, the process acts as a filter that protects us from the flood of information we are confronted with every day. Important information gradually transfers from short-term memory to long-term memory. The more often information is repeated or used and the more emotionally charged it is, the more likely it is to eventually end up in long-term memory to be retained.\nShort-term memory has a fairly limited capacity. It can store about four to seven items for no more than 20 or 30 seconds each. This capacity can be increased via various memory strategies. For example, a ten-digit number like 8005840392 can overwhelm the short-term memory. However, when broken down into parts, as with a phone number, 800-584-0-392 it can remain in short-term memory long enough for us to dial it. We group the available information, so that it can be remembered more easily. This is called chunking.\nChunks are a collection of information that have strong associations with each other, but weak associations with items within other chunks. Simply put, a chunk is a collection of related information. Something like a schema, a learning unit, or a functional unit. It has no clear boundary and there are no fixed chunks. Each person forms his or her own units. Thus, the word chunk is more of an abstract concept than clearly defined.\nChunks can be used to learn something new or interconnect topics with each other. Or we get new information on a topic for which we already have chunks in the long-term memory. In this case, we usually find it easier to remember something because we can link it to the information we already have. The more extensive the mental library of learning units, the easier it is to remember. So in general, if you want to learn something new, look at the big picture first to give your brain some orientation. This way it can perceive the context, and you can add details to the framework later on.\nWhen we learn something new, networks are built from the information units. Short-term memory can usually handle 4 -7 chunks at a time. When first learning a concept or technique to solve a problem, the entire working memory (aka short-term memory) is involved. Whenever we fragment a concept, the individual components will connect more easily and smoothly. Thus, only one space in the working memory is occupied. The rest of the working memory remains free. By fragmenting the material, the amount of information available in the working memory has, in a sense, increased. At the same time, it is easier to make new connections. Gradually, the learner recognizes connections between the new information and chunks that are already stored.\nOur brain operates primarily in two predominant modes of attention: focused thinking (the task-positive network) and fuzzy thinking (the task-negative network). These are called networks because they are made up of interconnected neurons (cells in the central nervous system) and act as electrical circuits in the brain. The focused mindset is active when you actively engage in a task and focus on it. The fuzzy mode of thinking is active when thoughts “digress,” colloquially known as daydream mode. Here seemingly disparate thoughts (from different subject areas) can be combined so that subject areas can be logically connected. We thus develop an intuitive assessment of topics. This brain state, characterized by the flow of connections between different ideas and thoughts, is responsible for the moments of highest creativity and insight, when we are able to solve problems that previously seemed unsolvable.\n!(../../static/img/Insula.jpeg)\n",
