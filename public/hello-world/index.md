# Hello World


And welcome to my blog â€˜Tingling Neuronsâ€™!

This is a space where I am sharing my thoughts, stories and views on the world. Or get them straight in the first place, since it is often a little bit chaotic in my head ðŸ˜‰

Maybe you are interested in similar topics like me: product management, personal development, productivity, work, philosophy, (neuro-) physiology, travelling and great stories.

And why Tingling Neurons? I like medicine (particularly Physiology) and I am totally amazed by how much can change, if we change our mindset. Also when we develop products. There are the most amazing thoughts and concepts out there, that are definitely worth discussing. So this blog is about my tingling neurons, your tingling neurons and our neurons tingling together. The name was my brothersâ€™ idea, but the passion is definitely mine ðŸ˜‰

Aaaaaannnnndd I did not want to use my name for this blog, since there is a huge stereotype around it
